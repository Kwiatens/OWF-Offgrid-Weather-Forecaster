# Building OWF R1 – 01 | Overview and Bill of Materials (BOM)

This section provides an overview of the OWF R1 hardware and a complete Bill of Materials (BOM) needed to build the **OWF R1** board.

The OWF R1 is the baseline version of the Offgrid Weather Forecaster. It features fully solar-powered operation, an onboard atmospheric sensor, and Meshtastic® LoRa communication.

OWF R1 Features:
- Fully offgrid operation
- Daily and on demand forecasts with >90% accuracy after calibration.
- Emergency alerts e.g: Storm, Strong wind etc.
- Current air pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed and more.
- Automatic calibration (user feedback)
  
This board will be compatible with OWF Anemomter Unit (AU) and OWF Lightning Detector Unit (LDU) once we release them.
It also has an SPI and I2C addon port for connecting peripherals like an air quality sensor.

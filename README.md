# Meshtastic powered Original Offgrid Weather Forecaster (OWF)
## [This project is work-in progress!]
OWF is an affordable, offgrid, [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/)® powered weather forecaster that does **NOT** use the internet for forecasting the weather. **Instead it uses its own sensors to calculate weather predictions using a Zambretti algorithm and a couple of other techniques.**
When calibrated, it can be over 90% accurate for short-term predictions!
